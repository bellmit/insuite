ATTENTION:

Mojito JS Loader has problems with special characters in file names.
Avoid -, multiple . and so on.

If you use other name structures as we currently have then check that they can really be loaded by
a directly browser access to the path

This is the reason why we have renamed some files (like jquery) compared to their orig packages
